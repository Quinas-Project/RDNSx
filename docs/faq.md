RDNSx is ideal for:
- **Penetration Testers** conducting network reconnaissance
- **Security Researchers** analyzing DNS infrastructure
- **Network Administrators** auditing domain configurations
- **Developers** building DNS-aware applications
- **Blue Team** defenders monitoring network security

### How is RDNSx different from other DNS tools?
RDNSx stands out with:
- **Rust Performance**: Memory-safe, zero-cost abstractions
- **Async Processing**: Up to 50+ concurrent DNS queries
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 27 DNS record types supported
- **Enterprise Features**: Database exports, Docker support
- **Security Focus**: Advanced DNSSEC and enumeration techniques

## 📦 Installation & Setup

### What's the easiest way to install RDNSx?
```bash
# Quick install via Cargo
cargo install rdnsx

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/Quinas-Project/RDNSx.git
cd RDNSx && cargo build --release
```

### Can I run RDNSx on Windows?
**Yes!** RDNSx supports Windows, Linux, and macOS. Use the same installation commands - Rust's Cargo handles platform-specific compilation automatically.

### Do I need Rust installed to use RDNSx?
**Only for source installation**. Pre-built binaries are available for download, but if you're building from source or installing via `cargo install`, you'll need Rust 1.70+.

### How do I verify RDNSx installation?
```bash
# Check version
rdnsx --version

# Test basic functionality
rdnsx --help

# Quick DNS test
echo "example.com" | rdnsx query
```

## ⚡ Performance & Speed

### Why is RDNSx fast?
RDNSx leverages **Rust's performance advantages**:
- **Zero-cost abstractions** - No runtime overhead
- **Async/await concurrency** - Non-blocking I/O operations
- **Memory safety** - Prevents common performance bottlenecks
- **Optimized algorithms** - Custom DNS protocol implementations

### How many DNS queries can RDNSx handle per second?
**Performance varies by network**, but RDNSx typically achieves:
- **Single queries**: 2-5ms average response time
- **Bulk operations**: 1000 domains in under 30 seconds
- **Concurrent processing**: Up to 50 simultaneous queries

### Does RDNSx support rate limiting?
**Yes!** RDNSx includes intelligent rate limiting to:
- Prevent IP blocking by DNS servers
- Respect rate limits automatically
- Maintain reliable scanning performance
- Avoid false positives from throttling

## 🔍 DNS Enumeration

### What DNS record types does RDNSx support?
RDNSx supports **all 27 major DNS record types**, including:
- **Basic**: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SOA, PTR
- **Security**: DNSKEY, DS, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3
- **Advanced**: SRV, CAA, HTTPS, SVCB, TLSA, URI, HINFO
- **Legacy**: AFSDB, CERT, DNAME, KEY, LOC, OPT, NAPTR, SSHFP

### How do I enumerate subdomains with RDNSx?
```bash
# Basic subdomain enumeration
rdnsx bruteforce --domain example.com --wordlist subdomains.txt

# With advanced options
rdnsx bruteforce --domain example.com \
  --wordlist subdomains.txt \
  --concurrency 100 \
  --wildcard-filter
```

### What's the difference between forward and reverse DNS?
- **Forward DNS (A/AAAA)**: Domain name → IP address
- **Reverse DNS (PTR)**: IP address → Domain name
- RDNSx handles both with `rdnsx query` and `rdnsx ptr`

---

## 🛡️ Security Research

### Can RDNSx be used for penetration testing?
**Absolutely!** RDNSx is designed for security research and includes:
- **Passive enumeration** techniques
- **DNSSEC analysis** and zone walking
- **Wildcard detection** and bypass methods
- **ASN intelligence** gathering
- **Email security** validation (SPF/DMARC/DKIM)

### How do I perform DNSSEC analysis?
```bash
# Comprehensive DNSSEC analysis
rdnsx enumerate --technique dnssec-enumeration --target example.com

# Zone walking (NSEC enumeration)
rdnsx enumerate --technique dnssec-zone-walking --target example.com
```

### What is ASN enumeration and why is it useful?
**ASN (Autonomous System Number) enumeration** discovers:
- IP address ranges owned by organizations
- Network infrastructure mapping
- Geographic location insights
- Provider identification (Google, AWS, Cloudflare, etc.)

```bash
# Enumerate Google ASN
rdnsx enumerate --technique asn-enumeration --target AS15169

# Works with or without AS prefix
rdnsx enumerate --technique asn-enumeration --target 16509
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### RDNSx is running slowly. What can I do?
**Performance optimization tips**:
1. **Check network connection** - DNS performance depends on your internet speed
2. **Use local resolvers** - Configure custom DNS servers in config
3. **Adjust concurrency** - Lower concurrent queries if experiencing timeouts
4. **Enable caching** - Use Redis or local cache for repeated queries

### Why am I getting timeout errors?
**Common causes and solutions**:
- **Network issues**: Check internet connectivity
- **Rate limiting**: Target servers may block rapid requests
- **Firewall blocking**: Some networks restrict DNS queries
- **DNS server issues**: Try different resolvers in config

### How do I configure custom DNS resolvers?
```toml
# rdnsx.toml
[resolvers]
servers = ["8.8.8.8", "1.1.1.1", "208.67.222.222"]
timeout = 5
retries = 3
```

## 🎯 Advanced Usage

### How do I export results to a database?
RDNSx supports multiple database exports:
```bash
# Export to Elasticsearch
rdnsx query example.com --export-elasticsearch

# Export to MongoDB
rdnsx query example.com --export-mongodb

# Export to Cassandra
rdnsx query example.com --export-cassandra
```

### Can I use RDNSx programmatically?
**Yes!** RDNSx provides a Rust library API:
```rust
use rdnsx_core::{DnsxClient, RecordType};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let client = DnsxClient::new()?;
    let records = client.query("example.com", RecordType::A).await?;
    println!("Found {} A records", records.len());
    Ok(())
}
```

### How do I use RDNSx with Docker?
```bash
# Pull the official image
docker pull quinas/rdnsx:latest

# Run basic queries
docker run --rm quinas/rdnsx query example.com

# Mount config volume
docker run --rm -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  quinas/rdnsx --config /app/config/rdnsx.toml query example.com
```
